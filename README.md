# CS-340-ClientServerDevelopment

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Some ways to write programs include proper naming conventions, following the accepted syntax, class organiztion, and keeping good comments to inform yourself and other developers what is happening with your code. When working with the CRUD module, it was important to create the different methods to be able to use the CRUD operations in our dashboard.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I approach a problem by first analyzing all parts of the issue, and figuring out a course of action. I approached the requirements in an incremental way that continued to build on itself each week. One major technique I would include would be to take my time when creating the user accounts. I accidentally fat-fingered a password that caused me a lot of unnecessary headaches. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer Scientists look at a problem and solve it. In our course we looked at a company who was trying to find dogs for certain types of rescue options, and we create a dashboard that would allow them to find those dogs more easily.
